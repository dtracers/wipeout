Source code for the [WipEout Model Viewer](http://phoboslab.org/wipeout/).

This repository does not contain the actual WipEout data files. You have to copy the `WIPEOUT/` directory from the original CD.

this fork is meant to be a playable racing game in a similar fashion as these types of racing games were the best things ever!

hopeful goals that make this better.

Fully upgradeable vehicles (in terms of engines, magnets, sideboost)
playable in a browser
hopefully cool track features!
